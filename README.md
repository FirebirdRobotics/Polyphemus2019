# Team 3019 Robot Code, 2018-2019 FRC Season

Robot Template Type: Command-Based

## Current Code Location:
The current code is located in the bin directory, not the src directory (src directory is not updated)

## Control Ideas/OI (for now):

Left Joystick - drive
 
Right Joystick - arm
 
A button - bottom elevator macro
 
B button - middle elevator macro
 
Y button - top elevator macro
 
X button - vision centering code
 
[insert button here] button - climb
 
[insert button here] button - claw
 
--- BELOW THIS IS STILL UNDECIDED (whatever was written down initially) ---
 
right trigger and bumper for hatch pickup, floor and loader

dpad for ball placement

joystick button for stilts

## Other stuff:

Read this to install the CTR-Electronics Phoenix software framework (for CAN motors/motor controllers):
https://phoenix-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

This is me updating the readme to test something with the git bash terminal, sorry if it annoys you branden

whoa i think im starting to figure this out

Stuff to do (general ideas):
- Ball pickup
- Dance function
- Maybe a document showing off our code to judges (vision, macros, etc.)

Vision to-do list:
- clean up the print lines
- make better comments (especially on the 'false thing' in VisionRoutine.java)
- maybe experiment w/ whether a timer or the iterations method is better (currently using the iterations thing)
- change buttons maybe?

Stuff we want to display on the SmartDashboard//Shuffleboard:
- camera feed (vision stuff) 
- type of drive
- eagle-eye view of robot & pathing (arrow showing where the robot might go next)
