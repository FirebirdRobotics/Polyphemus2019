This is me updating the readme to test something with the git bash terminal, sorry if it annoys you branden

whoa i think im starting to figure this out

Stuff to do:
- Ball pickup
- Dance function
- Maybe a document showing off our code to judges (vision, macros, etc.)

Stuff we want to display on the SmartDashboard//Shuffleboard:
- camera feed (vision stuff)
- type of drive
- eagle-eye view of robot & pathing (arrow showing where the robot might go next)
